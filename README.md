# HayBaleCNN
The network is a bastardised version of darknet-19. Current model is able to detect whether or not there's a hay bale in an image 92.9%-ish of the time.

Ultimately, this will be an object-detection network that can run comfortably on a Jetson TX1 to allow an agricultural rover to not hit hay bales constantly. One day.
